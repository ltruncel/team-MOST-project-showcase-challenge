# Project Overview

The goal of the project is to classify rice diseases using a rice disease dataset on Kaggle. By using various pretrained models (ResNet50, VGG19, [TBD]) we try to determine the best model for this task and analyze the pros and cons of each model.


# Dataset

The rice disease dataset is obtained via Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/minhhuy2810/rice-diseases-image-dataset. 
It contains 4 categories, all of which labeled: Brown Spot (523 files), Healthy (1488 files), Hispa (565 files), and LeafBlast (779 files)
